Description: Alep (also aleph) is the first symbol of the Semitic symbols "Abjads". This is the first proper theme I have made so it makes semse, I guess, to name it something like this. The theme is built upon the underscores.me code. Notable requirements and features of this theme is implementation of SASS (SCSS actually) and Javascript/Jquery. This theme is fully responsive and relies heavily on flexbox to make that happen.
